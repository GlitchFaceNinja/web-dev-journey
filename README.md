# W3Schools Tutorial Projects

Welcome to my W3Schools Tutorial Projects repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub where I document my learning journey through various web development tutorials on [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com). The goal is to provide a practical, hands-on approach to learning web development and programming by sharing real examples and projects I've worked on.

## About This Repository

As I progress through tutorials on W3Schools, I'll be uploading the completed exercises, examples, and personal projects related to the topics covered. This repository is not only a personal log of what I've learned but also a resource for others who are on a similar path in the world of web development.
